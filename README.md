# Crypto-Trading-Bot

## description:
**Crypto-Trading-Bot** is an application for users to trade or just keep updated with Tokens on the blockchain. My goal was to create a web application that allows users to watch trends with their favorite token, then buy or sell thier token. Users must register to the app to buy/sell. But the app is open for anyone to watch charts or make pretend trades.
